I am working on the first selection Idea 1: Logic Circuit Schematic Beautifier	
I have been searching for a c++ libraries that supports verilog parsing, I found Verific Design Automation, and I downloaded an evaluation package but I could not find the c++ header directory (although it is mentioned on the website that the package contains a c++ header file).So I decided to switch to Perl.
Here are quite good sources that explains the overall idea, that would help me dig into the project easily.
